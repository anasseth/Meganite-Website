        The<br />
        Meganite<br />
        Story<br />
      </h1>
      <p>
        Meganite is a private, family-owned<br />
        business founded by a chemical engineer.<br />
        He had a relentless focus on R&D to<br />
        provide quality products at the best value.<br />
        Starting with manufacturing composite<br />
        materials like resins, gel coats and color<br />
        paste, we eventually evolved to solid<br />
        surfaces which is our core focus.

        Today, as a US-based company, we<br />
        build off our long history and<br />
        expertise to continue to innovate on<br />
        acrylic solid surfaces. Our managing<br />
        philosophy is to partner for the long-<br />
        term, and grow with our distributors<br />
        and customers. As a solid partner,<br />
        some of Meganite’s distributor-<br />
        partnerships have lasted decades.

        resins including the chips in our patterned sheets.
